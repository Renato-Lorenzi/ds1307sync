This small package is a easy way to use ds1307. 

It combines the solution of synchronizing the datetime for ds1307 from ntp or chrony with the part of synchronizing ds1307 with the system.

It consists of a script based on https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/9791/how-can-i-automatically-update-the-hwclock-with-ntp-when-i-have-internet-connect

with some improvements.
